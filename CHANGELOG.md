## [0.8.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2023-03-15)

### Changes

-   Fix Local testing tool when using --skip_domain flag to skip specifying domain input file.
-   Fix to exit Aggregation worker when going out of memory. Enclave gets restarted automatically
    and continues to pick new jobs.

    able to start the enclave. Autoscaling group will replace the instance accordingly.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) (2023-03-07)

### Changes

-   Added error messages in Job result info returned as part of getJob API when uncaught exceptions
    happen and trigger job retries.

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0) (2023-02-23)

### Changes

-   Added Private Aggregation support for
    [FLEDGE](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api#reports) and
    [Shared-storage](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api#reports)
    reports in
    [local testing tool](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/v0.6.0/docs/API.md#local-testing-tool).

-   Aggregation worker Java heap memory limits increased to 75% of container allocated memory.

-   Miscellaneous Aggregate API documentation updates.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (2022-11-30)

### Changes

-   Upgraded control plane shared library dependency to
    [v0.39.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/control-plane-shared-libraries/tree/v0.39.0), which
    requires 6 Elastic IP addresses for the subnets of the created VPC. With the default
    [AWS VPC EIPs quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html)
    set to 5 per region, users may need to request for more quota when deploying the Aggregate
    Service or decrease the number of subnets created for the aggregation service VPC. To stay
    within the default quota you can decrease the number of subnets, by setting
    `vpc_availability_zones = ["a","b","c","d","e"]` in your `<name>.auto.tfvars`

-   Addressed both
    [security issues](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/blob/v0.4.0/README.md#general-security-notes)
    by uprading the control plane shared library dependency.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2022-10-24)

### Changes

-   Multi-party coordinator support added and made the default.
-   Aggregation Service enforces the
    [no-duplicate](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#no-duplicates-rule)
    rule. We recommend users design their systems keeping the no-duplicate rule in consideration. We
    suggest reading the [debugging](./DEBUGGING.md) document for debug aggregation runs.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (2022-06-30)

### Changes

-   Support for updated Attribution Reporting API
    [Aggregatable Reports](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#aggregatable-reports)
    format.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service/compare/v0.1.2...v0.2.0) (2022-06-09)

### Changes

-   The
    [`no-duplicate`](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#no-duplicates-rule)
    rule for privacy budget is not enforced anymore but will be enforced in the future. We recommend
    you design your systems with the `no-duplicate` rule in consideration.
-   Added support for relative paths in LocalTestingTool binary
-   Fixed issue with unexpected error messages in LocalTestingTool binary
